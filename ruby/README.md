# Dub with Ruby

This example shows how to use Dub with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

## Getting Started

1. Set your `DUB_API_KEY` environment variable:

```shell
export DUB_API_KEY=dub_xxx
```

2. Install dependencies:

```shell
bundle install
```

3. Run the create link script:

```shell
bundle exec ruby create.rb
```

This will create a new link in your Dub workspace and display the result in the console.
