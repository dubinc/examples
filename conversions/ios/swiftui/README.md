# Conversion tracking with SwiftUI and Dub

## Overview

This SwiftUI project is a product storefront built with the [DummyJSON
](https://dummyjson.com/) API. It shows how to handle deep links / deferred deep links
and conversion tracking with the [Dub iOS SDK](https://dub.co/docs/sdks/client-side-mobile/installation-guides/swift).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running, you must replace `DUB_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `DUB_DOMAIN` in `DubApp.swift` with your publishable key and domain. You may generate a publishable key by navigating to your [workspace's Analytics settings page](https://app.dub.co/settings/analytics) and generating a new publishable key under the **Publishable Key** section.
